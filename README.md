# Chromebook Carts (Cbc)
Chromebook Carts is inventory management software based off of the [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/). This software was created as a necessity to ease the process of collection, storage and distribution for student devices in a K12 school. Though I'm calling the software 'Chromebook Carts', that term is loose as the software doesn't care what model is being tracked; we just happen to use Chromebooks (I might eventually change the name).

**Warning** this software is not finished yet. It is currently a reincarnate of the original software I wrote but I will currently classify this as Beta. Most of the functionality is working but I still have a lot to do to work through the bugs, optimize and ensure it's security.
